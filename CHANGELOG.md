# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Windows compatibility** - removed dead `/dev/stdin` open in `detect_dupes.sh` that caused `FileNotFoundError` on Windows (Git Bash/MSYS2). The code was a no-op (`pass` body) and the actual data is read via `$TMPFILE` env var.
- **lint: false-positive CRITICAL for support folders** - folders without `SKILL.md` (e.g. `_shared`, `_docs`, `_temp`, plugin subdirs) are now silently skipped instead of emitting a spurious CRITICAL.
- **lint: multiline description parsing** - description values using YAML block scalars (`|`, `>`) are now collected across all indented lines via `awk`, fixing false "description too short" warnings. Long-description threshold raised from 250 → 500 chars to match real-world multi-line descriptions.
- **lint: new check for `disable-model-invocation` skills** - skills that set `disable-model-invocation: true` with a very short description now emit a WARNING, since Claude may not trigger them correctly.

## v1.1.0 (2026-04-15)

### New
- **Cross-platform support** - works with both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex
- `/janitor-precheck` - check overlap before installing a new skill
- `/janitor-tokens` - show context window token cost per skill

### Changed
- `/janitor-report` now includes lint checks, duplicate detection, and broken skill findings (was separate check/duplicates/cleanup commands)
- `/janitor-fix` gains `--prune` flag for removing broken symlinks and empty dirs
- `/janitor-search` gains `--compare <name>` flag for market comparison

### Removed (merged)
- `/janitor-check` -> use `/janitor-report`
- `/janitor-cleanup` -> use `/janitor-fix --prune`
- `/janitor-duplicates` -> use `/janitor-report`
- `/janitor-compare` -> use `/janitor-search --compare <name>`

## v1.0.0 (2026-03-24)

Initial release with 9 skills: audit, duplicates, check, fix, cleanup, report, usage, search, compare.
